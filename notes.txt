A few different fisherman mentioned getting it when out of cell range,
In area with bad/no cell reception, trying to log in, failed and dropdown lists wouldn't work.
Both platforms, no so prevalent but maybe because filling out after the trip.



Logbook editing

- Fine to edit any field, time cap of 1 week past original submission date. 
- Option to move over sets from active trip to in-edit trip.
- Hope for, version number associated with record, just a one, two, three..
- Original submission, with- Multiple edits allowed
- Each resubmission doesn't need to include original submission time
- User only needs to see latest update on app
- Big warning to submit edits and option to discard edits
- If starting edits but didn't finish, make it clear to user
- Discard unsubmitted edits if time window passes

- Logbook with version and date of resubmission to send to same logbook submit endpoint




Left to do on current implementation
- Reload on a page while editing the delivery
- Delivery list indicates edited delivery
- Conflict resolver for edited landing
- Set adding functionality in editing
- Trip validator works with edited delivery
- Summary report adjusted to accommodate edited delivery
- Warnings when editing/discarding changes, check if multiple logbooks being edited
- Submission functionality. Hitting same submission endpoint, new fields on submission model
- What if set part of edited delivery is also part of current delivery?
- When to check if edit deadline has passed for delivery in edit? Login? App component startup?
- When submitting, when going to edited delivery, in app startup

Bugs
- Adding vessels while offline causes duplicate vessels in lists --done!
- Refresh token messing things up after going airplane mode then back online?
- Help section! - Try breaking everything down to a class inheritance scheme?
-- Operator name is not saving on resubmitted deliveries, it shows as correct everywhere except the detail page


More/Better warnings when discarding edits?
How to record re-submission date? Desired format?

Now need to have existing sets editable?

Approach:

When user goes to edit a pre-existing set:
1. Recreate that set and add it to user_sets on device
	- This will mess with the preExistingSets map variable on the delivery detail.

2. From there it's like any other set, code to handle its updates if on edited delivery is already there I think
	- Should it be prevented from being added to current delivery?
	- If the edits are discarded, should the recreated set be deleted?
	- Maybe add an extra variable to the set model, indicating if it's an old set?
	
	


Another approach:
- Don't create a new set, pull it out and save it entirely within the edited_delivery
- Back button, home button
